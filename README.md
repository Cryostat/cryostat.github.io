Front End Web Development

This is my project for my Front End Web Development Project. This is a website that is supposed to be for a doughnut shop that I like to visit sometimes. I don't own the business, but I'm a fan of what they do. It's supposed to be a mock website of a small business.

1.CSS Feature
There is a hamburger menu that opens and closes on the top righthand side of the website.

2.JavaScript Feature
I have five variables declared on 4-7 and 23 and their values are used to display the hamburger menu.

3.JavaScript Feature
I have one Javascript object value that is modified and displayed on the site.

There are no special instructions to run this website. It should run normally by just visiting the website.
